docker-listenz
==============

This Docker image sets up a running instance of the [ListenzTracker 
script](https://liste.nz), a script to scrobble [Spotify](https://spotify.com) 
tracks to [Last.fm](http://last.fm) using both APIs and thus saving you from
setting up scrobbling in every Spotify instance. It also enables you to
scrobble tracks from the Spotify Web Player.

This is currently work in progress. Check out the 'develop' branch for now.
